Welcome to Spherical-Scikit-Learn's documentation!
==================================================
This python library is to conduct Spherical Clustering and von Mises-Fisher Mixture Model with ``scikit-learn``-like APIs. Compared to `spherecluster <https://github.com/jasonlaska/spherecluster>`_, this library was implemented with ``Cython`` code, like the native implementations of ``sklearn.cluster.KMeans`` or ``sklearn.mixture.GaussianMixture`` in ``scikit-learn``.
