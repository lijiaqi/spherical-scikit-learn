    Parameters
    ----------
    X : {array-like, sparse matrix} of shape (n_samples, n_features)
        The data to pick seeds from.

    n_clusters : int
        The number of centroids to initialize.

    sample_weight : array-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None
        The weights for each observation in `X`. If `None`, all observations
        are assigned equal weight. `sample_weight` is ignored if `init`
        is a callable or a user provided array.

    random_state : int or RandomState instance, default=None
        Determines random number generation for centroid initialization. Pass
        an int for reproducible output across multiple function calls.
        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.

    n_local_trials : int, default=None
        The number of seeding trials for each center (except the first),
        of which the one reducing inertia the most is greedily chosen.
        Set to None to make the number of trials depend logarithmically
        on the number of seeds (2+log(k)) which is the recommended setting.
        Setting to 1 disables the greedy cluster selection and recovers the
        vanilla k-means++ algorithm which was empirically shown to work less
        well than its greedy variant.

    Returns
    -------
    centers : ndarray of shape (n_clusters, n_features)
        The initial centers for k-means.

    indices : ndarray of shape (n_clusters,)
        The index location of the chosen centers in the data array X. For a
        given index and center, X[index] = center.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <k_means>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : {array-like, sparse matrix} of shape (n_samples, n_features)
        The observations to cluster. It must be noted that the data
        will be converted to C ordering, which will cause a memory copy
        if the given data is not C-contiguous.

    n_clusters : int
        The number of clusters to form as well as the number of
        centroids to generate.

    sample_weight : array-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None
        The weights for each observation in `X`. If `None`, all observations
        are assigned equal weight. `sample_weight` is not used during
        initialization if `init` is a callable or a user provided array.

    init : {'spherical-k-means++', 'random'}, callable or array-like of shape \
            (n_clusters, n_features), default='spherical-k-means++'
        Method for initialization:

        - `'spherical-k-means++'` : selects initial cluster centers for k-mean
          clustering in a smart way to speed up convergence. See section
          Notes in k_init for more details.
        - `'random'`: choose `n_clusters` observations (rows) at random from data
          for the initial centroids.
        - If an array is passed, it should be of shape `(n_clusters, n_features)`
          and gives the initial centers.
        - If a callable is passed, it should take arguments `X`, `n_clusters` and a
          random state and return an initialization.

    n_init : 'auto' or int, default="auto"
        Number of time the k-means algorithm will be run with different
        centroid seeds. The final results will be the best output of
        n_init consecutive runs in terms of inertia.

        When `n_init='auto'`, the number of runs depends on the value of init:
        10 if using `init='random'` or `init` is a callable;
        1 if using `init='spherical-k-means++'` or `init` is an array-like.

        .. versionadded:: 1.2
           Added 'auto' option for `n_init`.

        .. versionchanged:: 1.4
           Default value for `n_init` changed to `'auto'`.

    max_iter : int, default=300
        Maximum number of iterations of the k-means algorithm to run.

    verbose : bool, default=False
        Verbosity mode.

    tol : float, default=1e-4
        Relative tolerance with regards to Frobenius norm of the difference
        in the cluster centers of two consecutive iterations to declare
        convergence.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Determines random number generation for centroid initialization. Use
        an int to make the randomness deterministic.
        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.

    copy_x : bool, default=True
        When pre-computing distances it is more numerically accurate to center
        the data first. If `copy_x` is True (default), then the original data is
        not modified. If False, the original data is modified, and put back
        before the function returns, but small numerical differences may be
        introduced by subtracting and then adding the data mean. Note that if
        the original data is not C-contiguous, a copy will be made even if
        `copy_x` is False. If the original data is sparse, but not in CSR format,
        a copy will be made even if `copy_x` is False.

    algorithm : {"lloyd"}, default="lloyd"
        K-means algorithm to use. The classical EM-style algorithm is `"lloyd"`.
        The `"elkan"` variation can be more efficient on some datasets with
        well-defined clusters, by using the triangle inequality. However it's
        more memory intensive due to the allocation of an extra array of shape
        `(n_samples, n_clusters)`.

    return_n_iter : bool, default=False
        Whether or not to return the number of iterations.

    Returns
    -------
    centroid : ndarray of shape (n_clusters, n_features)
        Centroids found at the last iteration of k-means.

    label : ndarray of shape (n_samples,)
        The `label[i]` is the code or index of the centroid the
        i'th observation is closest to.

    inertia : float
        The final value of the inertia criterion (sum of squared distances to
        the closest centroid for all observations in the training set).

    best_n_iter : int
        Number of iterations corresponding to the best results.
        Returned only if `return_n_iter` is set to True.

    Examples
    --------

class SphericalKMeans(_BaseKMeans):
    """Spherical K-Means clustering.

    Parameters
    ----------

    n_clusters : int, default=8
        The number of clusters to form as well as the number of
        centroids to generate.

    init : {'spherical-k-means++', 'random'}, callable or array-like of shape \
            (n_clusters, n_features), default='spherical-k-means++'
        Method for initialization:

        * 'spherical-k-means++' : selects initial cluster centroids using sampling \
            based on an empirical probability distribution of the points' \
            contribution to the overall inertia. This technique speeds up \
            convergence. The algorithm implemented is "greedy spherical-k-means++". It \
            differs from the vanilla spherical-k-means++ by making several trials at \
            each sampling step and choosing the best centroid among them.

        * 'random': choose `n_clusters` observations (rows) at random from \
        data for the initial centroids.

        * If an array is passed, it should be of shape (n_clusters, n_features)\
        and gives the initial centers.

        * If a callable is passed, it should take arguments X, n_clusters and a\
        random state and return an initialization.

        For an example of how to use the different `init` strategy, see the example
        entitled :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_cluster_plot_kmeans_digits.py`.

    n_init : 'auto' or int, default='auto'
        Number of times the k-means algorithm is run with different centroid
        seeds. The final results is the best output of `n_init` consecutive runs
        in terms of inertia. Several runs are recommended for sparse
        high-dimensional problems (see :ref:`kmeans_sparse_high_dim`).

        When `n_init='auto'`, the number of runs depends on the value of init:
        10 if using `init='random'` or `init` is a callable;
        1 if using `init='spherical-k-means++'` or `init` is an array-like.

    max_iter : int, default=300
        Maximum number of iterations of the k-means algorithm for a
        single run.

    tol : float, default=1e-4
        Relative tolerance with regards to Frobenius norm of the difference
        in the cluster centers of two consecutive iterations to declare
        convergence.

    verbose : int, default=0
        Verbosity mode.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Determines random number generation for centroid initialization. Use
        an int to make the randomness deterministic.
        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.

    copy_x : bool, default=True
        When pre-computing distances it is more numerically accurate to center
        the data first. If copy_x is True (default), then the original data is
        not modified. If False, the original data is modified, and put back
        before the function returns, but small numerical differences may be
        introduced by subtracting and then adding the data mean. Note that if
        the original data is not C-contiguous, a copy will be made even if
        copy_x is False. If the original data is sparse, but not in CSR format,
        a copy will be made even if copy_x is False.

    algorithm : {"lloyd"}, default="lloyd"
        spherical K-means algorithm to use. The classical EM-style algorithm is `"lloyd"`.
        The `"elkan"` variation can be more efficient on some datasets with
        well-defined clusters, by using the triangle inequality. However it's
        more memory intensive due to the allocation of an extra array of shape
        `(n_samples, n_clusters)`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    cluster_centers_ : ndarray of shape (n_clusters, n_features)
        Coordinates of cluster centers. If the algorithm stops before fully
        converging (see ``tol`` and ``max_iter``), these will not be
        consistent with ``labels_``.

    labels_ : ndarray of shape (n_samples,)
        Labels of each point

    inertia_ : float
        Sum of squared distances of samples to their closest cluster center,
        weighted by the sample weights if provided.

    n_iter_ : int
        Number of iterations run.

    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of features seen during :term:`fit`.

    feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)
        Names of features seen during :term:`fit`. Defined only when `X`
        has feature names that are all strings.

    Notes
    -----
    The spherical k-means problem is solved using either Lloyd's or Elkan's algorithm.

    The average complexity is given by O(k n T), where n is the number of
    samples and T is the number of iteration.

    The worst case complexity is given by O(n^(k+2/p)) with
    n = n_samples, p = n_features.
    Refer to :doi:`"How slow is the k-means method?" D. Arthur and S. Vassilvitskii -
    SoCG2006.<10.1145/1137856.1137880>` for more details.

    In practice, the k-means algorithm is very fast (one of the fastest
    clustering algorithms available), but it falls in local minima. That's why
    it can be useful to restart it several times.

    If the algorithm stops before fully converging (because of ``tol`` or
    ``max_iter``), ``labels_`` and ``cluster_centers_`` will not be consistent,
    i.e. the ``cluster_centers_`` will not be the means of the points in each
    cluster. Also, the estimator will reassign ``labels_`` after the last
    iteration to make ``labels_`` consistent with ``predict`` on the training
    set.
